### Purpose & North-Star Vision

**Create the most bias-free, on-field-only ranking of Division I college-football teams that anyone can regenerate from public data.**
*Every* design choice flows from three imperatives:

1. **Conference neutrality** – No league should float (or sink) just because most of its games are internal.
2. **Schedule-strength incentives** – Programs should gain more rating equity—win or lose—by playing strong opponents than by stock-piling cupcakes.
3. **Transparency & auditability** – A curious fan or data scientist must be able to re-run the model, step through every multiplier, and reach the same table.
