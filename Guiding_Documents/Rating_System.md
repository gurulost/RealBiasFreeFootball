Below is a **single-document blueprint** to have the system running.  It locks in:

* **LIVE track** – weekly ratings with snapshot expectations + uncertainty-shrinkage.
* **RETRO track** – a once-per-season, full-hindsight re-rating computed from scratch after the final CFP championship.

All parameters are set to sensible defaults; every place you might tune is flagged.
